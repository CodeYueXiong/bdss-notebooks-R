    "\n",
    "SQL is a language designed for a very specific purpose: to interact with relational databases. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Database**: A database is a structured collection of data. There are various different ways of structuring the database, and there may or may not be information about the relationship between entities in the database.\n",
    "- **Query**: A query is a request for data from the database. \n",
    "- **Database Management System (DBMS)**: A DBMS is a system of storing and managing databases, including querying the database.\n",
    "- **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)**: In an RDBMS, data records are stored in *tables*, each of which has a predefined set of *columns*, the pieces of information captured for each record in a table, and *rows* in the table, where each row has a place to store a value for every column in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tables, including their columns, column types and relationships with other tables, are defined in a database **schema**. Many times, tables will contain a **primary key**, one or more columns that uniquely define a row. You can think of the primary key as a kind of ID, in which each row is given a unique ID. Tables can also contain  **foreign keys**, which are column(s) that comprise the primary key in another table and, thus, provides a way of matching between multiple tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will use SQL to:\n",
    "- Select data subsets\n",
    "- Sum over groups\n",
    "- Create new tables\n",
    "- Count distinct values of desired variables\n",
    "- Order data by chosen variables"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LIMIT:** We typically include a `LIMIT` statement at the end of our query so that we don't get overloaded with rows being output. Here, `LIMIT 20` means that we just want the first ten rows. Many times, the `LIMIT` that you want will be higher than 20 -- you might generally prefer to use 1000 or so. Having a `LIMIT` for all queries is highly recommended even if you know only a few rows will be shown, since it acts as a safety precaution against (for example) displaying millions of rows of data.\n",

    "\n",
    "> ### Side note about capitalization\n",
    "If you notice, we've been using all caps for SQL commands and all lowercase for data table and schema names. This is simply a convention, as SQL is not case sensitive. For example, we could have run `select * from inmate limit 20;` and it would have given us the exact same output as the first query. \n",
    "\n",
    "> This does mean you need to be careful when using column names. If your column name has capital letters in it, you need use double quotes (e.g. `\"C000\"`) to preserve the capitalization. For this reason, you might find that using all lowercase letters in column names is preferable, which is what we've done here.\n",
